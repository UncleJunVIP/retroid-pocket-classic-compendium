# Retroid Pocket Classic Compendium üìì

It is no secret that I am *addicted* to retro gaming handhelds.

I wanted a place to capture things about my Retroid Pocket Classic setup.

I don't claim to be an expert and will likely have done something stupid or wrong.

For more detail from an actual expert, go check out [Retro Game Corps'](https://retrogamecorps.com) guides and videos.

If it exists, Russ has a video for it.

*With that in mind, here goes nothing!*

## Wrangling the Apps üêÇ‚û∞ü§†

After the initial Retroid-provided setup, I installed the following:

1. [Emulation Station Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) (paid, but extremely reasonable)
2. [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
3. [RetroArch (AArch64) Nightly Config](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev) (use the filter function)
4. [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
5. [Primitive FTPd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.primftpd/) via F-Droid
6. [Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/) via F-Droid
7. [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/) via F-Droid

## High-Level RetroArch Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Emulator Cores

- Game Boy / Color (Gambatte)

These are all recommended by
RGC's [RetroArch Starter Guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/02/28/retroarch-starter-guide/)

Why only these systems? This is what I play. I'm a simple man.

### Global RetroArch Settings

These settings will be displayed as nested lists. The nesting follows the navigational hierarchy.

Settings will be displayed as Setting Name: Value

Notes included when for sections when spelling out the value of every setting is cumbersome.

If a setting is not listed, a safe assumption is I am using the default.

Saving Notes

These first four options make it so RetroArch behaves like my beloved NextUI (MinUI).

Auto Save / Load allows you to quit with Start + Select and not worry! 
A save state will be made on quit and loaded on start. Seamless!

This again is to NextUI-ify this Android setup. 
I also have ES-DE pointed at SD_CARD/ROMs for games.
