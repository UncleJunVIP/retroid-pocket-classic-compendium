# Retroid Pocket Classic Compendium üìì

It is no secret that I am *addicted* to retro gaming handhelds.

I wanted a place to capture things about my Retroid Pocket Classic setup.

I don't claim to be an expert and will likely have done something stupid or wrong.

For more detail from an actual expert, go check out [Retro Game Corps'](https://retrogamecorps.com) guides and videos.

If it exists, Russ has a video for it.

*With that in mind, here goes nothing!*
