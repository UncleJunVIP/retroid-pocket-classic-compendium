# Retroid Pocket Classic Compendium üìì

It is no secret that I am *addicted* to retro gaming handhelds.

I wanted a place to capture things about my Retroid Pocket Classic setup.

I don't claim to be an expert and will likely have done something stupid or wrong.

For more detail from an actual expert, go check out [Retro Game Corps'](https://retrogamecorps.com) guides and videos.

If it exists, Russ has a video for it.

*With that in mind, here goes nothing!*

## Wrangling the Apps üêÇ‚û∞ü§†

After the initial Retroid-provided setup, I installed the following:

1. [Emulation Station Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) (paid, but extremely reasonable)
2. [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
3. [RetroArch (AArch64) Nightly Config](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev) via Obtainium App Configuration
    - use the filter function to find the RetroArch configuration
4. [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
5. [Primitive FTPd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.primftpd/) via F-Droid
6. [Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/) via F-Droid
7. [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/) via F-Droid

## High-Level RetroArch Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Emulator Cores

- Game Boy / Color (Gambatte)
- Game Boy Advance (mGBA)
- Nintendo Entertainment System (Nestopia)
- Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Snes9x)
- Sega Genesis (Genesis Plus GX)
- PlayStation (SwanStation)

These are all recommended by
RGC's [RetroArch Starter Guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/02/28/retroarch-starter-guide/)

Why only these systems? This is what I play. I'm a simple man.

### Global RetroArch Settings

These settings will be displayed as nested lists. The nesting follows the navigational hierarchy.

Settings will be displayed as Setting Name: Value

Notes included when for sections when spelling out the value of every setting is cumbersome.

If a setting is not listed, a safe assumption is I am using the default.

### User Interface

    - Notification Visibility (Everything Off Except For)
        - Input (Autoconfig) Failure Notifications

- Sort Save into Folders by Content Directory: On
- Sort Save States into Folders by Content Directory: On
- SaveRAM compression: On

```
Saving Notes

These first four options make it so RetroArch behaves like my beloved NextUI.

Auto Save / Load allows you to quit with Start + Select and not worry! 
A save state will be made on quit and loaded on start. Seamless!
```

---

### Configuration

- Save Configuration on Quit: On
- Save Remap Files on Quit: On

---

### Directory

- System/BIOS: `SD_CARD/BIOS`
- Save Files: `SD_CARD/Saves`

```
Directory Notes

This again is to NextUI-ify this Android setup. 
I also have ES-DE pointed at SD_CARD/ROMs for games.

## ES-DE Configuration

## System Name Customization (es_systems.xml)

‚ú® *To perform any of these changes, you will need a copy of
[es_systems.xml](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/resources/systems/android/es_systems.xml)* ‚ú®

### Renaming Systems

To rename a system, simply change the value of the `<fullname>` tag for the corresponding `<system>`.

---

### Change System Display Order

Use the following snippet as an example to edit your `es_systems.xml` file.

(Note the `<command>` tags have been omitted for clarity.)

```xml

<systemList>
    <system>
        <name>gb</name>
        <fullname>Game Boy</fullname>
        <systemsortname>001 - BTK</systemsortname>
        <path>%ROMPATH%/gb</path>
        <extension>.bs .BS .cgb .CGB .dmg .DMG .gb .GB .gbc .GBC .sgb .SGB .sfc .SFC .smc .SMC .7z .7Z .zip .ZIP
        </extension>
        ...
        <platform>gb</platform>
        <theme>gb</theme>
    </system>
    <system>
        <name>gbc</name>
        <fullname>Game Boy Color</fullname>
        <systemsortname>002 - BTK</systemsortname>
        <path>%ROMPATH%/gbc</path>
        <extension>.bs .BS .cgb .CGB .dmg .DMG .gb .GB .gbc .GBC .sgb .SGB .sfc .SFC .smc .SMC .7z .7Z .zip .ZIP
        </extension>
        ...
        <platform>gbc</platform>
        <theme>gbc</theme>
    </system>
</systemList>
```

ES-DE uses the `<systemsortname>` tag to determine system order.

I went with this naming scheme of `Platform Order - My Initials`. Use whatever makes sense to you.

To make sure ES-DE uses your custom ordering, be sure to set `Systems Sorting` to `Full Names or Custom` under
`UI Settings`.
