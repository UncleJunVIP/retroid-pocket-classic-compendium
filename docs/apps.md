## Wrangling the Apps

After unboxing and following the initial Retroid-provided setup, I installed the following:

1. [Emulation Station Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) (ES-DE), paid, but extremely reasonable (~$5)
2. [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
3. [RetroArch (AArch64) Nightly Config](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev) via Obtainium App Configuration
    - use the filter function to find the RetroArch configuration
4. [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
5. [Primitive FTPd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.primftpd/) via F-Droid
6. [Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/) via F-Droid
7. [Apple Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.android.music) via Play Store

## What do these apps do?

1. **Emulation Station Desktop Edition:** serves as the Android Launcher and Emulator Frontend. This application will
   curate
   the ROM collection and launch RetroArch when a title is selected.
2. **Obtanium:** is a handy utility to installing Android App directly from the source.
3. **RetroArch:** is the muscle. While RetroArch is a capable frontend, ES-DE will be providing that functionality.
   RetroArch will instead be used to install and configure the different emulator cores.
4. **F-Droid:** is an alternative to the Play Store and is the source for a bunch of great apps in this list.
5. **Primitive FTPd:** is a lightweight and free SFTP server. Useful for getting files to the device without removing
   the SD Card.
6. **Tailscale:** is a godsend for those that dabble with self-hosted stuff. Tailscale is a software-defined, mesh,
   virtual private network. Put simply, any device connected to a shared Tailnet (Tailscale Network) can communicate to
   with one another without exposing the device to the public internet. This allows me to
   access [RomM](https://romm.app) from my RPC.
7. **Apple Music:** is self-explanatory. I use a lot of Apple products so this is really convenient.
