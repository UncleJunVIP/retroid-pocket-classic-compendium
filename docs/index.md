## Well, hello there! üëãüèª

My name is Brandon, and I am *addicted* to retro gaming handhelds.

I wanted a place to capture things about my Retroid Pocket Classic setup.

## What can I expect?

A *mostly* streamlined and highly opinionated setup for the Retroid Pocket Classic.

Will every choice shared here be good? Probably not!

Hopefully, you find some helpful tips and can use them to make the RPC your own.

## The Disclaimer

I don't claim to be an expert and will likely have done something stupid or wrong.

If it exists, Russ has a video for it.

*With that in mind, here goes nothing!*
