## Hello there!

My name is Brandon, and I am *addicted* to retro gaming handhelds.

I wanted a place to capture things about my Retroid Pocket Classic setup.

## What can I expect?

A *mostly* streamlined and highly opinionated setup for the Retroid Pocket Classic.

Will every choice shared here be good? Probably not!

Hopefully, you find some helpful tips and can use them to make the RPC your own.

I am not an expert, nor would I ever claim to be!

Some of my preferences might seem stupid or wrong.

*With that in mind, here goes nothing!*
